# Boomtown üèô
An application that uses PostgreSQL to store shareable items and user info. 

It uses Node.js/Express as its web server, and GraphQL for its client-facing API.

# Technologies: 

The following technologies were applied in building and delivering Boomtown's backend application:- 

1.	JavaScript  
1.	GraphQL
1.  Express
1.  Node
1.  POSTGRESQL
1.  Apollo 


#  Personal Learning Developments: 

1.	GraphQL can be used to Query from an API and/or Database.

1.	GraphQL requires a Schema which consists of TypeDefs & Resolvers

1. Resolvers are a method or a function that resolves a value for a field or type in a schema.

1.  Efficient Query Language that mitigates over-fetching and under fetching data
